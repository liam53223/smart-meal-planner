# Quick Context: FlavorMonk Meal Planning App

I'm building a $4.99/month meal planning app with these unique features:
- Recipes that adapt to specific appliances (air fryer, Instant Pot, etc.)
- Medical condition support (PCOS, diabetes, IBS)
- AI chatbot "Kojo" that helps users
- 345 recipes currently in database

## Top 5 Questions I Need Help With:

1. **Missing Recipes**: "What are the top 20 must-have recipes I'm likely missing that users expect in a meal planning app?"

2. **Appliance Conversions**: "What's the formula to convert a 400Â°F oven recipe to air fryer and Instant Pot?"

3. **Meal Plan Logic**: "How do I create 7-day meal plans that reuse ingredients to minimize waste while keeping variety?"

4. **Make-ability Score**: "What factors determine if someone will actually cook a recipe vs just save it?"

5. **Grocery Organization**: "What's the optimal order for a shopping list that matches how people actually shop?"

## Quick Recipe Stats:
- Breakfast: 75 recipes
- Lunch: 90 recipes  
- Dinner: 105 recipes
- Snacks: 60 recipes
- Average cook time: 25 minutes
- All include full nutritional data

What would make this the meal planning app YOU would actually use daily?
