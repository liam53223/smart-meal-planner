## **‚ö†Ô∏è Predicted Issues & Mitigation Strategies**

### **Technical Challenges**
1. **AI Response Consistency**
   - Issue: OpenAI responses may be inconsistent
   - Solution: Structured JSON output + validation layers + fallback templates

2. **Database Performance**
   - Issue: Complex filtering queries may be slow
   - Solution: Proper indexing + caching layer + query optimization

3. **Recipe Scaling Accuracy**
   - Issue: Ingredient scaling isn't always linear
   - Solution: Ingredient-specific scaling rules + chef validation

### **Business Challenges**
1. **Medical Liability**
   - Issue: Providing medical nutrition advice
   - Solution: Clear disclaimers + healthcare provider partnerships + liability insurance

2. **Recipe Copyright**
   - Issue: Using existing recipes may have copyright issues
   - Solution: Original recipe development + proper attribution + user-generated content

3. **Nutritional Accuracy**
   - Issue: Nutritional calculations may be inaccurate
   - Solution: USDA database integration + professional nutritionist review

### **User Experience Challenges**
1. **Questionnaire Fatigue**
   - Issue: Long questionnaire may cause abandonment
