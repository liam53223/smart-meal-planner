# FlavorMonk - Smart Meal Planning App Context

## üéØ Project Overview
I'm building **FlavorMonk** (formerly Smart Meal Planner), a personalized meal planning SaaS app that uses AI to create custom meal plans based on users' health conditions, preferences, and available appliances.

**Target Market**: Health-conscious individuals who want personalized nutrition but struggle with meal planning
**Pricing**: $4.99/month subscription
**Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod), Ollama (local AI) + DeepSeek (cloud AI)

## üåü Key Differentiators
1. **Appliance Optimization**: Recipes adapt to user's specific appliances (air fryer, Instant Pot, etc.)
2. **Medical Condition Support**: Tailored for PCOS, diabetes, IBS, autoimmune conditions
3. **Evidence-Based Spice Blends**: Clinical research-backed spice combinations for health benefits
4. **Kojo AI Personality**: Engaging chatbot with 5 moods that adapts to conversation
5. **Hybrid AI Approach**: 80% local (free), 20% cloud for complex queries

## üìä Current Status
- **Recipe Bank**: 345 recipes loaded (target: 500)
- **Recipe Categories**: Breakfast (75), Lunch (90), Dinner (105), Snacks (60), Other (15)
- **Completion**: ~70% architecture done, ~30% implementation done
- **Missing**: User auth, payment system, actual UI pages

## üç≥ Recipe System Design
Each recipe includes:
- Name, description, ingredients, instructions
- Prep/cook time, servings, complexity (1-5)
- Nutritional info (calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sodium)
- Appliance requirements
- Health goal tags (weight_loss, muscle_gain, heart_health, etc.)
- Cost tier (budget, moderate, premium)

## ü§î Questions for Cooking GPT

### 1. **Recipe Quality & Variety**
"I have 345 recipes in my database. What key recipe types or cuisines am I likely missing that users expect? What would make my recipe collection feel more complete?"

### 2. **Appliance Adaptation**
"I want recipes to automatically adapt for different appliances. For example, a chicken recipe might have variations for oven (25 min), air fryer (18 min), or Instant Pot (12 min). What are the key conversion rules I should implement for each appliance?"

### 3. **Meal Planning Intelligence**
"What logic should I use to create weekly meal plans that are: (a) nutritionally balanced, (b) use overlapping ingredients to reduce waste, (c) vary in complexity throughout the week, and (d) respect user's time constraints?"

### 4. **Recipe Success Predictors**
"Based on your knowledge, what makes a recipe likely to be actually cooked vs just saved? I want to optimize for recipes people will actually make."

### 5. **Spice & Flavor Intelligence**
"I'm implementing evidence-based spice blends (turmeric+black pepper, cinnamon for blood sugar, etc.). What other scientifically-backed spice combinations should I include?"

### 6. **Shopping List Optimization**
"How should I group ingredients in shopping lists to match typical grocery store layouts? What's the best way to handle ingredient substitutions?"

### 7. **Cultural Sensitivity**
"How can I ensure my recipe adaptations respect cultural authenticity while making them accessible? For example, adapting Indian recipes for American kitchens without losing authenticity."

### 8. **Quick Meal Hacks**
"What are the top 10 'cooking hacks' or techniques that would help busy users save time without sacrificing nutrition or flavor?"

## üí° Specific Areas for Feedback

1. **Recipe Gaps**: What essential recipes am I missing?
2. **User Experience**: What features would make users actually stick to their meal plans?
3. **Health Optimization**: How to balance taste with health goals?
4. **Batch Cooking**: Best approach for meal prep functionality?
5. **Dietary Restrictions**: How to handle multiple restrictions elegantly?

## üéØ Ultimate Goal
Create an app that makes healthy cooking so easy and personalized that users actually cook more at home, save money, and improve their health - all for $4.99/month.

**Current Challenge**: I have good architecture but need to ensure the recipe content and meal planning logic will actually deliver value to users.
