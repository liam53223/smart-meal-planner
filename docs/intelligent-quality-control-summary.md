# 🎯 Intelligent Quality Control & Optimization System

## Overview
A comprehensive system that ensures recipe quality, prevents storage bloat, and continuously improves based on user feedback.

## 🛡️ Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Factor Recipe Quality Scoring**
Each recipe is scored on multiple dimensions:
- **User Satisfaction** (40%): Average rating from feedback
- **Nutritional Value** (20%): Balanced nutrition scoring
- **Success Rate** (20%): How many people complete vs start
- **Ingredient Availability** (10%): Common vs rare ingredients
- **Repeat Rate** (10%): How often users make it again

### 2. **Automatic Recipe Pruning**
System automatically removes:
- Recipes with <3.5 stars after 10+ reviews
- Recipes with >30% complaint ratio
- Recipes with <50% completion rate
- Unused recipes after 6 months
- Duplicate/similar recipes

### 3. **Storage Optimization**
Per-user storage is capped at 1MB with intelligent cleanup:
- Archives old meal plans (>6 months)
- Compresses user preferences
- Removes unused recipe cache
- Consolidates duplicate feedback

### 4. **Continuous Feedback Collection**

#### Micro-Interactions Tracked:
```javascript
{
  viewed: true,          // User looked at recipe
  saved: true,           // User bookmarked it
  started: true,         // User began cooking
  completed: true,       // User finished cooking
  photoUploaded: true,   // User shared result
  sharedWithFriends: true, // Social proof
  madeAgain: true        // Ultimate success metric
}
```

#### Smart Feedback Prompts:
- Quick popup after 5 minutes: "Did you make this?"
- One-click responses: "Yes!", "Saved", "Not yet"
- Detailed feedback only if they cooked it
- Photo upload for social proof

### 5. **Gamified Feedback System**
Achievements to encourage quality feedback:
- 5 reviews: "Taste Tester" 🍴
- 25 reviews: "Recipe Reviewer" ⭐
- 50 reviews: "Culinary Critic" 👨‍🍳
- 100 reviews: "Master Chef" 🏆

### 6. **Intelligent Recipe Improvement**
System analyzes feedback patterns and auto-improves:
```javascript
// Common issues detected and fixed:
{
  "too spicy" → Reduce spice amounts
  "took longer" → Update cooking time
  "portions too small" → Adjust servings
  "confusing step 3" → Clarify instructions
}
```

### 7. **Real-Time Quality Monitoring**
Every hour, the system:
- Checks for trending complaints
- Flags problematic recipes
- Promotes improved recipes
- Alerts admins of issues

## 📊 Quality Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Rating | < 3.5/5 | Archive after 10 reviews |
| Complaints | > 30% | Flag for review |
| Completion | < 50% | Simplify or archive |
| Storage/User | > 1MB | Auto-cleanup |
| Unused Time | > 180 days | Archive |
